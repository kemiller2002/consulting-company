      <h1>Technology Architecture</h1>
      <p>Designing systems that scale, evolve, and deliver real-world impact.</p>

      <h2>What We Offer</h2>
      <ul>
        <h2>Legacy Modernization & System Audits</h2>
        <p>
          We evaluate and upgrade aging systems to align with today’s performance, security, and scalability demands.
          Whether
          your stack is held together by deprecated code or over-extended middleware, we help you untangle the
          complexity and
          build a roadmap toward streamlined, future-proof infrastructure.
          <em>Modernization doesn’t mean “rebuild everything” — it means knowing what to preserve, what to enhance, and
            what to
            retire.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Microservices & Distributed Architecture Design</h2>
        <p>
          We design modular, scalable systems that grow with your organization. By moving away from monoliths and toward
          service-oriented architecture, we help you improve deployment speed, team independence, and system resilience.
          <em>Architecture isn’t just tech — it’s culture. We design systems that reflect how your teams actually
            work.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Cloud Migration Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you’re moving from on-prem to the cloud or re-evaluating your multi-cloud setup, we create cloud
          strategies
          that balance cost, security, and performance.
          <em>Migration is more than a lift-and-shift — it’s an opportunity to realign your business logic with modern
            platforms.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>AI/ML System Integration Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          We help you integrate AI into your infrastructure in a way that’s explainable, maintainable, and aligned with
          real
          business value. From model pipelines to data readiness assessments, we build the systems that let your AI
          tools
          thrive.
          <em>AI is only as strong as the system it lives in. We make sure it has the foundation it needs.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Value Impact Analysis & Strategic Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t just build systems — we measure their impact. Our value assessment process helps you understand where
          your
          architecture is driving performance, where it's holding you back, and where to invest next.
          <em>We give you clarity — not just in architecture diagrams, but in strategic next steps.</em>
        </p>
