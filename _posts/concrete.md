# 🧱 Concrete Forensics: Diagnosing Failure in Plain Sight

**Category:** Applied Diagnostics · **Focus Areas:** Structural Analysis · Process Integrity · Compliance Mapping

When a newly poured pool deck began showing surface discoloration, hairline cracks, and standing water within weeks of completion, most observers saw _“bad concrete.”_  
Echelon Foundry saw a **system failure** — a convergence of mix, method, and management.

Using the **Echelon Diagnostic Framework (EDF)**, we approached the problem like a clinician would a patient:

### Step 1 – Understanding & Domain Research

We reconstructed the pour environment through mix tickets, weather records, and ASTM/ACI references.  
Every actor—supplier, contractor, and inspector—was mapped to the stage they influenced.

### Step 2 – Symptom Identification & Pattern Recognition

Hardness readings, slope variance, and color patterns were cataloged into verified symptom clusters: pooling, chalking, and efflorescence.

### Step 3 – Mechanistic Analysis & Causal Mapping

From these clusters, we built fault trees showing how improper slope, excess on-site water, and premature finishing combined to produce the observed defects.

### Step 4 – Pathology Classification

The analysis revealed a dominant **process pathology** (workmanship and curing control), with secondary design contributions (formwork slope).

### Step 5 – Treatment & Prevention Strategy

We defined a corrective pathway—core testing, slope re-establishment, and a verification protocol tied to ASTM C39/C42—to restore integrity and prevent recurrence.

> The result wasn’t a blame narrative; it was a **structured diagnosis** that turned scattered complaints into actionable engineering data.

Echelon’s methodology transforms _“what went wrong”_ into **reproducible evidence** — the kind of insight that stands up in both boardrooms and courtrooms.

## **Key Deliverables**

- Multi-layer causal map linking field process to material behavior
- Quantitative slope, rebound, and moisture data with variance analysis
- ASTM-aligned remediation plan and retest matrix

## **Outcome**

> Identified root causes prior to destructive testing, saving months of dispute escalation and defining a defensible correction plan.
