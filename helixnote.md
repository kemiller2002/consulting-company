      <h3>What it is</h3>
      <p>A lightweight, AI-assisted workflow that keeps decisions, context, and evidence in one place. It is delivered with guidance, not as a stand-alone SaaS.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Who it’s for</h3>
      <p>CEOs, VPs Eng, product leaders, and investors working in regulated or high-stakes environments who need reliable signal, not scattered notes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>The problem it solves</h3>
      <p>Fragmented documentation, unclear ownership, and missing decision history that slow delivery, muddle diligence, or weaken incident response.</p>

    <h2>What makes it different</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Context stays intact</h3>
      <p>Templates tuned for finance, engineering, and compliance so summaries don’t lose the details leaders need.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Decision trails by default</h3>
      <p>Every note links to owners, dates, and evidence—useful for board packets, audits, and handoffs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Human-led, tool-assisted</h3>
      <p>We deploy HelixNote alongside our consulting work to ensure adoption and to calibrate claims. No “set it and forget it.”</p>
