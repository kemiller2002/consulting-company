<h1 id="case-study-medical-complexity-resolved">Case Study: Medical Complexity, Resolved</h1>

<p><strong>Client:</strong> A family managing a multi-month diagnostic journey involving overlapping symptoms, hormone irregularities, and unclear specialist findings.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>The family had seen multiple specialists, visited the ER several times, and had lab results scattered across different systems. Symptom progression, triggers, and failed treatments were being tracked manually in spreadsheets and sticky notes. Time was being lost repeating history at every visit, and no physician had the full context.</p>

<h2 id="helixnote-solution">HelixNote Solution</h2>

<p>HelixNote was deployed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Log daily symptoms, lab results, and treatment outcomes</li>
  <li>Cross-reference historical patterns (e.g., “cold intolerance coinciding with low glucose events”)</li>
  <li>Generate monthly summaries with AI highlighting key shifts (e.g., sudden onset fatigue after estrogen drop)</li>
  <li>Retain a searchable record of doctor instructions, insurance calls, and ER visits</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>

<ul>
  <li>During a critical endocrinology visit, the HelixNote export provided a concise but rich patient timeline</li>
  <li>The provider recognized a hormonal cascade that matched a rare disorder, confirmed by targeted testing</li>
  <li>Treatment began earlier than typical, reducing long-term complications and stress</li>
  <li>The patient’s case is now used (anonymously) to train HelixNote’s health data model for better early detection</li>
</ul>
