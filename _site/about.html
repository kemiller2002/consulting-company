        <h2>About Echelon Foundry</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Echelon Foundry</strong> is the consulting practice of Kevin Miller, a seasoned technology executive
          with
          over 25 years of experience transforming engineering organizations and aligning software systems with
          strategic
          goals. His cross-sector background spans finance, nonprofit, food systems, and consumer tech—each engagement
          grounded in deep technical insight and operational pragmatism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kevin has led architectural modernization efforts for platforms serving 17 of the top 20 financial
          institutions
          managing donor-advised funds, cut operational expenses by over $500,000 annually through vendor and process
          optimization, and reduced time-to-market from 6 weeks to just 2 days via delivery pipeline redesign.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to hands-on architecture and engineering leadership, Kevin consults on <em>agile
            transformation</em>—including culture shift, process audits, and delivery acceleration—and provides
          <em>financial
            analysis for investors</em>, helping evaluate the technical and operational health of potential portfolio
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a former Microsoft MVP, technical reviewer, public speaker, and educator, Kevin brings a unique blend of
          engineering depth, business fluency, and creative thinking. He’s also a trained chocolatier and former
          culinary
          competitor—applying the same precision and creativity from the kitchen to systems, code, and strategy.
